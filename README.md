# Regression-Model-Comparison---California-Housing-Dataset.
Explore and compare the performance of three regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest) on the California Housing dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, splitting into training and testing sets, and thorough exploration of each algorithm's hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

Overview:
# Overview:
# Dataset:
Utilized the California Housing dataset.
# Data Handling:
Preprocessed and explored the data.
# Data Split:
Segregated the dataset into training and testing sets.
# Regression Algorithms:
Employed three regression algorithms - Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
# Hyperparameter Tuning:
Applied GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters for enhanced model performance.

# Key Metrices:
Linear Regression MSE: 0.56
Decision Tree MSE: 0.50
Best Random Forest MSE: 0.26

# Conclusion:
The Random Forest regression model demonstrated superior performance with the lowest mean squared error (MSE) of 0.26.
The conclusion suggests that Random Forest is the most suitable algorithm among the three for accurately predicting housing prices in the California Housing dataset.
